# Get In - a disc golf app for putting practice 

## Project Description
This application is a simple app that disc golf players could use to practice and improve their putting game. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can select the number of putts for each round from a dropdown menu, mark whether they made or missed each putt, and view their stats for that round. 

## Tech Used
The entire application was written in Kotlin, a language I had no prior experience with before this project. Kotlin is Google's preferred language for Android development and is similar to Java, another language commonly used for Android development. Building this app was an amazing learning experience for me. Teaching myself how to work with Kotlin and Android Studio not only gave me experience with these technologies but was also very rewarding. One challenge I faced with this project was becoming comfortable with a new IDE. I initially felt unproductive because much of my time was spent figuring out how to navigate the IDE. However, once I became comfortable with Android Studio, I was able to navigate and utilize the tools with relative ease. 

## Future plans
In the future, I would like to add a feature that allows users to view their past putting rounds. To achieve this, I plan to build a backend for the application to allow the data to be persistent. Additionally, I want to implement a feature that gives users the option to input what they are putting with, allowing them to easily compare their stats with different putters.
