# Get In - a disc golf app for putting practice 

## Project Description
This application is a simple app that disc golf players could use to practice putting. As there is only one main feature currently implemented, the UI is very simple. A user can select how many throws, hit a make/miss button for each throw, and see their stats for that round.    

## Tech Used
The entirety of the application was written in Kotlin, which, prior to this project, I had no experince with. Kotlin is google's preferred language for android development and is similar to Java, another language that is often used for android development. Building this app was an amazing learning experience for me. Teaching myself how to work with Kotlin and Android Studio not only gave me experience these technologies, but also was a very rewarding experience. A challenge that I faced with this project was the process of becoming comfortable in a new IDE. I felt unproductive when I began the project because a lot of my time was taken up by figuring out how to navigate the IDE. However, once I became comfortable with Android Studio, I was able to navigate and utilyze the tools with realative ease.   

## Future plans
In the future, I would like implement a feature where a User could look at past putting rounds they have had. I would like to do this by building a backend for the application so that the data is persistent. Following this, I want to add a feature where you may input which disc you are putting with so that you can seamlessly compare your putting stats with different discs.
